# Starbound__FR_Protogen-Race-Patch_UNOFFICIAL
 A patch to integrate Protogen Race Mod with Frackin -RACES-. NOT FOR FU.
 
# Who is this for?
Some people have opted to continue using the older *Frackin' Races* mod from before it was rolled into FU. Lots has changed in terms of the stats files - but I mistakenly used FR's as my initial template, so no reason for the effort to go to waste.

If you have no reason not to, *Frackin' Universe* has all the same content and far more. Plus, it will actually be updated. FR is deprecated and will receive no further fixes.

# Where's the download/How to install?
You can use the normal folder structure here, and stick it in /Starbound/mods/<folder> or you can make use of this [**.PAK**](https://github.com/CanadianVice/Starbound__FR_Protogen-Race-Patch_UNOFFICIAL/blob/main/fr_protogenrace1_patch.pak).  
I've read it can be faster. No idea, but them's the options.

# Caveats
I'm not a professional modder, this is literally just putting together some text files. So it could be buggy or have things not work (the documentation isn't amazing for how Sayter's implemented some of this). 

I am not in a position to install standalone *Frackin' Races*. So I can't do full testing on this - but there is no reason to expect it shouldn't work. It matches the templates to a tee.

In other words, if somehow it isn't... don't invest too much time figuring it out. It may simply be broken and there's not much I can do about that.

# Where can I find more information?
While the stats will differ from those shown in the mainline patch for *Frackin' Universe*, the spirit of things and most of the other details (IE: installation instructions, legal and licensing) are the same. See the mainline patch git [*Here*](https://github.com/CanadianVice/Starbound__FU_Protogen-Race-Patch_UNOFFICIAL]).

# Important
 This mod requires both Frackin' Races and Protogen Race Mod to play. Find links for download in the mainline patch's readme.
 
 This mod is **unofficial**. Don't bother either mod author about it. Further, barring minor adjustments, it's offered **as-is** and no further changes/updates will be forthcoming.
